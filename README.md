Overview
The goal of this competition is to create models that can be used to aid in the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images. Competitors will develop models that simulate a radiologist's performance in diagnosing spine conditions.

Low back pain, affecting over 619 million people, is the top cause of disability globally. It often indicates degenerative spine conditions like disc degeneration and spinal stenosis, which can be diagnosed with MRI.

RSNA and ASNR are hosting a competition to see if AI can assist in detecting and classifying these spine conditions using MRI images of the lumbar spine. The focus is on classifying five specific conditions across different spinal levels, with severity scores provided for each.

The challenge uses a diverse dataset from multiple institutions worldwide to improve classification standards and develop tools for automated disease assessment.
